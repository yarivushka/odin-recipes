<div class="ingredients">
   <p><strong>A Schnitzel is a thin slice of meat, breaded before frying</strong>. Breaded schnitzel is popular in many countries and is made using veal, pork, chicken, mutton, beef, or turkey. Schnitzel is very similar to the dish escalope in France, tonkatsu in Japan, cotoletta in Italy, kotlet schabowy in Poland, milanesa in Argentina, chuleta valluna in Colombia, and chicken-fried steak and pork tenderloin of the United States.</p>
   <p><em>In short, it is an internationally common food that has different names in different cultures</em>.</p>
