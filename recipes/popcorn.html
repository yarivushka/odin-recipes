<div class="title">What is Popcorn?</div>

<p class="Ingredients">Popcorn (also called popped corn, popcorns or pop-corn) is a variety of corn kernel which expands and puffs up when heated.</p>

<div class="title">How it works???</div>

<p class="Ingredients">The corn kernel's strong hull contains the seed's hard, starchy shell endosperm with 14â€“20% moisture, which turns to steam as the kernel is heated. Pressure from the steam continues to build until the hull ruptures, allowing the kernel to forcefully expand, to 20 to 50 times its original volume, and then cool</p>

<div class="title">Ingredients</div>

<ul class="ingredients">
    <li>Popcorn suited kernels</li>
    <li>Oil</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
       
</ul>

<div class="title">Steps</div>

 <ol class="ingredients">
    <li>Put a thin layer of oil in a large pot, such that it covers the pot's bottom. Better to use a tall pot, <strong><em>must have a lid. If children are involved, you'll want a trnsparent one :)</em></strong></li>
    <li>Put a thin layer of popcorn kernels that will cover the oil</li>
    <li>Heat it up on high fire (or electric heat sourc)</li>
    <li>When you hear first pops, lower to medium fire/heat</li>
    <li>When it stops popping, turn heat source off, add some salt and serve in a large ball while watching a movie :)</li>
